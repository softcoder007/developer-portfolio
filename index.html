            <p>No matter how excited you are about your dream, it will take time. Accept it. People who don’t accept it
                will quit from frustration. Greatness doesn’t come over night. As they say:“if it were easy everybody
                would do it.”But one thing you can always do, at any moment, is to take another step. If you’re feeling
                exhausted, take a step towards resting. If you’re feeling stuck, take a step towards being re-inspired
                and letting your creativity flow again.</p>
