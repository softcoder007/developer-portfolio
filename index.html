            <p>No matter how excited you are about your dream, it will take time. Accept it. People who don’t accept it
                will quit from frustration. Greatness doesn’t come over night. As they say:“if it were easy everybody
                would do it.”But one thing you can always do, at any moment, is to take another step. If you’re feeling
                exhausted, take a step towards resting. If you’re feeling stuck, take a step towards being re-inspired
                and letting your creativity flow again.</p>

            <p>Success can be dangerous because it fools us into thinking that we know what we’re doing. The truth is,
                whatever endeavor we are involved in we are going to have to change, evolve and learn; constantly. Learn
                from your mistakes.

                Don’t be scared of failure. Just focus on what you’ve learned and you will stay on the right track.</p>
